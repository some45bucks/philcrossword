                This Crossword puzzle is based on the idea of foundherentisim posed by Susan Haack (pg 85). 
            This Puzzle replicates it by getting justification from the the experience (the scene), and 
            the justification of know facts (other words). So some entrys will only be able to be easily completed by 
            looking at the crossword itself and not at the scene.

                This was all made from scratch by me (Jacob Haight), expect for the art assets (not an artists but a programmer).
